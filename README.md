# C implementations of simple data structures

## Do not use this.

This is a simple repository where I upload my trash implementation for the world to see.

For documentation, go to the README.md for that directory and hope I wrote something.

## Notes:
- Remember to compile to object file with LTO or change them to header files (and change extern to static inline) to include.
